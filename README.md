# JS Console
This is a temporary (I hope) image while my [pull request](https://github.com/remy/jsconsole/pull/55) is accepted
(again, I hope) by [jconsole](http://jsconsole.com/)'s real [author](https://github.com/remy/jsconsole).


# How to use this image
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name jsconsole cachavezley/jsconsole
Then go to `localhost:8080` in your browser.
